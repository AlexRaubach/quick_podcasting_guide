Now that I have the processed audio, I want to add the intro/outro music and then convert the file to my preferred bitrate. 

I have an audacity project with the intro and outro music in place and set to the correct volume. All I have to do is add the mixed audio as a new track, have it start right as the intro winds down and then move the outro to the very end. Lastly I load the .mp3 metadata from a saved file, set the title to the episode number and then export with a CBR (Constant BitRate) of 64 kbps. I tend to lean towards smaller file sizes over a (imo) marginal increase in audio quality that you can get by using a 128 kbps or higher bitrate.

## Episode Production

Once I have the finished audio, it's time to actually publish the episode

The first step is to upload the audio to our hosting provider. I've been using PodBean because they have a reasonable price and a not-completely-terrible website. Once it's been uploaded copy the link to the audio file.

Next I post on the site that hosts our primary RSS feed, teamcovenant.com. After constructing a basic blog post about the episode's topic and mention all the standard things (music licensing info, our email, our patrons etc)

After that, I make a quick post on the podbean blog (this lets the podbean rss feed serve as a backup feed) and then make any necessary social media posts (facebook, reddit, forums, patreon etc)
